Step 1: Find the equation of the first line.
To find the equation of the line with a slope of $-3$, we can use the Point-Slope formula. Since the line passes through point $E(3,3)$, we can substitute the values into the formula:
$y-3 = -3(x-3)$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$y = -3x + 12$
So the equation of the first line is $y = -3x + 12$.
Step 2: Find the equation of the second line.
To find the equation of the second line, we can use the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$. We know that the line passes through point $C(6,0)$, so we can substitute the values into the formula:
