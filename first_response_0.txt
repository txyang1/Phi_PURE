To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of distributing indistinguishable objects (items) into distinguishable bins (bags). However, in this case, the bags are identical, which makes the problem a bit more complicated. Nonetheless, we can still use the concept of partitions of an integer to solve this problem.
Step 1: Understand the problem
We have 4 items and 3 identical bags. We want to figure out the number of ways we can distribute the 4 items into the 3 bags.
Step 2: Consider the possibilities
Let's think about the different ways the items can be distributed into the bags:
a) All 4 items in one bag: This is not possible since we have 3 bags, and we need to distribute the items into at least 2 bags.
b) 3 items in one bag and 1 item in another bag: There are 4 ways to choose the bag that will contain 3 items. After choosing that bag, there are 3 ways to choose the bag with 1 item. However, since the bags are identical, swapping the contents of the two bags doesn't count as a different outcome. So, there are 4 * 3 / 2 = 6 ways to distribute the items in this case.
c) 2 items in one bag, 1 item in another bag, and 1 item in the last bag: There are 4 ways to choose the bag that will contain 2 items. After choosing that bag, there are 3 ways to choose the bag with 1 item. Since the bags are identical, swapping the contents of the two bags with 1 item doesn't count as a different outcome. So, there are 4 * 3 / 2 = 6 ways to distribute the items in this case.

Answer: There are 6 ways to distribute the 4 items into the 3 identical bags.
