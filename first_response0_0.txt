First, define the situation: We have 8 people, 4 of whom are "sure" (S) and 4 who are only 1/3 sure (S3). We want to find the probability that at least 7 people stayed for the entire game.
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:
Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select a group of 7 or more people who stayed the entire time out of the 8 people. This involves calculating all possible combinations.
- We can choose groups of 7 people out of 8 in C(8, 7) = 8! / (7!(8-7)!) = 8 ways.
- We can choose groups of 8 people out of 8 in C(8, 8) = 8! / (8!(8-8)!) = 1 way.
- Total ways = 8 + 1 = 9 ways.
Step 2: Calculate the probability of each of these combinations occurring.
- If 7 people stayed, then one of the 4 unsure people (S3) must not have stayed, and the other 7 sure people (S) stayed. The probability of this happening is (1/3) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = (1/3) * (1/4)^3 * (2/3)^4 = (1/3) * (1/64) * (16/81) = 16/1728 = 1/108.
- If 8 people stayed, then none of the 4 unsure people (S3) stayed and all 4 sure people (S) stayed. The probability of this happening is (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = (2/3)^4 = 16/81.
Step 3: Determine the probabilities that at least 7 people stayed by summing the probabilities from Step 2:
- Probability(7 people stayed) = 9 * (1/108) = 1/12.
- Probability(8 people stayed) = 16/81.
Step 4: Find the total probability that at least 7 people stayed:
- Total probability = Probability(7 people stayed) + Probability(8 people stayed) = 1/12 + 16/81.
- Convert to a common denominator: 1/12 = 9/108 and 16/81 = 64/216.
- Total probability = 9/108 + 64/216 = 18/216 + 64/216 = 82/216 = 41/108.

Therefore, the probability that at least 7 people stayed the entire time is \boxed{\frac{41}{108}} .
