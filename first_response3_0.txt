To find the area of triangle \(ABC\), let's follow these steps:
1. Since \(AB = BC\) and the triangle is acute, we know that the altitude \(AD\) from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\) bisects \(BC\) at point \(D\). This means that \(BD = DC\).
2. Given \(AD = 8\), since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), segments \(BD\) and \(DC\) each have length \(8\).
3. Now it is given that \(AH = 5\), and \(H\) is the orthocenter of the triangle. The altitude \(CH\) is thus perpendicular to side \(AB\), and as \(H\) lies above \(D\), \(CH\) extends through \(D\).
4. To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base \(BC\) is \(BD + DC = 8 + 8 = 16\), and the height is \(AD = 8\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 128 = 64
\]

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\boxed{64}\).

Thus,
